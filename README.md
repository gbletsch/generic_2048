# generic_2048
Naive python version of the game [2048](https://play2048.co/).

## Installing
This was made just for fun.
To run the game you can clone the repository or just copy main.py and run it using:

``` python

python main.py

```

## Requirements
You need Python 3 and the Pygame module installed:

``` python

pip install Pygame
pip install numpy

```

I hope you enjoy it.
